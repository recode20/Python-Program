"""      Question #4:
 Problem Statement
A chocolate factory is packing chocolates into the packets. The chocolate packets here
 represent
an array of N number of integer values. The task is to find the empty packets(0) of chocolate
 and
 push it to the end of the conveyor belt(array).
 Example 1 :
 N=8 and arr = [4,5,0,1,9,0,5,0].
 There are 3 empty packets in the given set. These 3 empty packets represented as O should be
 pushed towards the end of the array
 Input :
 8-Value of N
 [4,5,0,1,9,0,5,0]- Element of arr[O] to arr[N-1],While input each element is separated by
 newline
 Output:
 4 5195000
 Example 2:
 Input:
 6 —Value of N.
 [6,0,1,8,0,2]- Element of arr[0] to arr[N-1], While input each element is separated by newline
 Output:
 6 18200     """
